# FACE-RECOGNITION

- A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, 
typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.
- In this model only the <strong>Haarcascades:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/NAVANEETHELITE/FACE-RECOGNITION/blob/master/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"></a> of a face is used for comparing the facial features with that of the input face.
- Advanced algorithms like CNN's can be used for better recognition and results!
- Sample output is shown below :
